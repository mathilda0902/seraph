Basically, I’m looking at starting up an LLC that deals with several areas of educational and professional services (language education and writing and editing services). However, I’m having some difficulty deciding upon the state to register the LLC in. This is primarily because I tend to move around quite a bit, and I will be conducting business both online and in-person with individuals and entities in America and around the world.</p> <p>So far, it seems like Delaware and Wyoming seem to be the better choices, but I’ve also seen cases made for Nevada and Texas. Basically, I’m looking for your input to help me figure out what might be the best step forward from here. I should also add that I may wind up being more nomadic with the business as well (traveling to different countries for brief periods of time and also conducting business while I’m traveling). It’s possible too that I might just root in somewhere in America, and if so, I imagine I could change the location of my business registration at that time, right?</p> <p>Like I said, I’m a bit lost in all this, so if you can lend a hand, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you have.

       "   'summary': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi folks,</p> <p>I apologize if this has already been answered, but I’ve been reading through the subreddit, and I’m getting some conflicting information. Basically, I’m looking at starting up an LLC that deals with several areas of educational and professional services (language education and writing and editing services). However, I’m having some difficulty deciding upon the state to register the LLC in. This is primarily because I tend to move around quite a bit, and I will be conducting business both online and in-person with individuals and entities in America and around the world.</p> <p>So far, it seems like Delaware and Wyoming seem to be the better choices, but I’ve also seen cases made for Nevada and Texas. Basically, I’m looking for your input to help me figure out what might be the best step forward from here. I should also add that I may wind up being more nomadic with the business as well (traveling to different countries for brief periods of time and also conducting business while I’m traveling).
